## Preamble

I want to be clear on some points before starting this article:

1. This is not going to be a Fiat Vs. Bitcoin argumentation: I both believe both of them are equally bad
2. There's not any alternative: I'm not here to tell you "you shouldn't use Bitcoin, use XXXXXX instead!".
3. I've been in the community long enough and I have a technical expertise to be able to expose this theory.

Said so, let's start from the beginning.

## There are three kind of persons who advocate for Bitcoin

I've been in the Bitcoin community long enough to be able to recognize 3 kind of persons when it comes up to Bitcoin advocacy, and when I talk about Bitcoin advocacy, I'm referring to any kind of activity which promotes Bitcoin as the best option to replace the current FIAT standard with the **Bitcoin standard**. These kind of activities spread in their definition from a tweet to a no-profit organization organizing and promoting conference to spread the credo.

### Those who are in for business

This is the first category we can identify, which are all of those people who promote bitcoin for a personal economic return. The more people use Bitcoin, the more its value will be and the more money I will make.

I have nothing against this category, except the fact they probably don't really believe in Bitcoin from an ideological point of view, but probably because this makes them richer.

But, Business is business, so I can't blame them.

BUSINESS IS BUSINESS

### Anti-governmentalists

People who are in any case and with no exception against everything the government does. We have many of them in Europe and they find in Bitcoin the weapon to fight against taxes, confiscation of assets, FIAT electronic payments, CBDC, vaccines, green politics and yet, everything the government says.

### Libertarians

This is the category I'm more worried about. Personally I don't consider myself a libertarian and to be honest I find many aspects of this ideology utopistic and far from a real world implementation, but I would say that 99% of them a pro-bitcoin since it can perfectly fit with libertarism.

## Bitcoin and Libertarism

If we wanted to resume in key-points the aspects that make Bitcoin for libertarians a perfect match, we could just list these points:

- **Decentralization**: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning no single entity controls it. This aligns with libertarian views against centralized control by governments or central banks.
- **Limited Supply**: The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, which prevents devaluation through inflation, a common critique of fiat currency systems by libertarians.
- **Financial Sovereignty**: Bitcoin allows individuals to have full control over their money, without needing permission from banks or government institutions for transactions.
- **Privacy**: While not completely anonymous, Bitcoin transactions can offer more privacy than traditional banking systems, aligning with the libertarian value of individual privacy.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Transactions cannot be easily censored or blocked by states or financial institutions, promoting freedom of commerce.
- **Borderless**: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world with an internet connection, facilitating global trade without the need for currency exchange or government oversight.
- **Access to credit**: Bitcoin makes access to credit feasible for everyone, since there's no bank account to open. A mobile or a computer is enough to have access to their account.

I want to be clear: these aspects of Bitcoin are 100% accurate, for the moment at least.

But there is a huge problem with that: **these aspects won't be possible in the long terms**.

GIF WAIT WHAT

Well, at least not all of them. Some of them are actually feasible nowadays and they will always be in the long terms, such as access to credit, borderless and privacy (more or less)
